# Speedbuster

## What is Speedbuster?

An application that allows anyone to swiftly report incidents of speeding violations and have that information readily accessible to law enforcement agencies and other organisations with the aim of making our streets safer.

## Why am I developing it?

This repository is for me to improve my skills in ruby and general software development. I have chosen to start with a lightweight framework such as Sinatra rather than using Ruby-on-Rails.

## How to use it?

For the time-being, only end-users will have a reason to use this application. This will become available as soon as I have hosted the MVP.
