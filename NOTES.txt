objectives:
1- create a simple CRUD application using Sinatra framework instead of Rails.
2- compare and contrast the expierience of building the application in these two framworks
3- discuss what are the advantages and disadvantages of the each framwork for this context
4- Host it on a server (e.g. Render)
5- Write a blog post about what I learnt.


Product
----------------
Web application that allows public to report speeding violations.
Required paths:
get '/' => (Home)
get '/reports' => get a list of all reports
get '/report/:id' => show me one specific report
post 'report' => create a new report listing
put 'report/:id' => update an exisiting report
delete 'report/:id' => remove a report. 


Notes:
1- don't worry about testing for the time-being


Questions:
1- what testing framworks are available for use with Sinatra?
2- In Ruby on Rails, I'm used to seing a file called Gemfile that contains a list of all the gems that should be installed using bundler. How do you install gems with Sinatra?
3- I keep seing reference to DSL. They use the term in the GH page to describe Sinatra. What does DSL mean?
4- How does Stimulus work without Rails? (Kitt)
5- What are the dependecies that Sinatra needs? (e.g. Puma?)
6- What is Rubygems?
7- What is a template engine / language?
7- What does bundle init do?


To do:
1- Add git ignore and ignore the NOTES.txt file
2- Design basic user-flow in Whimsical
3- Design basic site pages in Figma
4- Build MVP locally
5- Deploy MVP to heroku / render.
