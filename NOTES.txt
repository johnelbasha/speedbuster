objectives:
1- create a simple CRUD application using Sinatra framework instead of Rails.
2- compare and contrast the expierience of building the application in these two framworks
3- discuss what are the advantages and disadvantages of the each framwork for this context
4- Host it on a server (e.g. Render)
5- Write a blog post about what I learnt.


Notes:
1- don't worry about testing for the time-being


Questions:
1- what testing framworks are available for use with Sinatra?
2- In Ruby on Rails, I'm used to seing a file called Gemfile that contains a list of all the gems that should be installed using bundler. How do you install gems with Sinatra?
3- I keep seing reference to DSL. They use the term in the GH page to describe Sinatra. What does DSL mean?
4- How does Stimulus work without Rails? (Kitt)
5- What are the dependecies that Sinatra needs? (e.g. Puma?)
